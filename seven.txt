The main objective of three level architecture is to enable multiple users to access the same data with a personalized view while storing the underlying data only once. Thus it separates the user's view from the physical structure of the database. This separation is desirable for the following reasons:

Different users need different views of the same data.
The approach in which a particular user needs to see the data may change over time.
The users of the database should not worry about the physical implementation and internal workings of the database such as data compression and encryption techniques, hashing, optimization of the internal structures etc.
All users should be able to access the same data according to their requirements.
DBA should be able to change the conceptual structure of the database without affecting the user's
Internal structure of the database should be unaffected by changes to physical aspects of the storage.

2=>Conceptual level
3=>External level
